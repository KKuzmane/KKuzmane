### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kristine. I am always open to learnÂ something new, and I love to use my mind to create new ways to improve productivity. Previously, I worked in small companies, so I had to be a one-man-orchestra. Because of that, I have no problem with adjusting to new things and learning new fields.
