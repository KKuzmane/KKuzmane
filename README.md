### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kristine. I am always open to learn something new and I love to use my mind for creating new ways to improve productivity. Previously I have worked in small companies, so I had to be one-man-orchestra. Because of that I have no problem with adjusting to new things and learning new fields.
